# Simple-Template-Symposium-Abstracts

## Summary
This project is a simplified example of how to organize different abstracts for talks given in a symposium. It was created using Overleaf (compiler: pdfLaTeX; TeX Live version: 2019; main document: main.tex).

## Overleaf
Overleaf ([overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/)) is an online LaTeX editor that's easy to use. It requires no installation and allows real-time collaboration, and version control. Among other interesting features, Overleaf comes with hundreds of LaTeX templates, tutorials, tips, and more.

## How to add this template to your Overleaf page
Download this repository as a compressed file (`.zip`) and follow the instrusction on how to upload a project to Overleaf that ate available at [www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Uploading_a_project](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Uploading_a_project).

## Basics
- All commented text starts with a `%` sign. If you want to actually type a `%` sign to text, type `\%`. Files have some helpful comments, be sure to read them.
- You don't need to escape special caracters in this project (line in `g\'enero`), there is a package that will take care of that for you. Go ahead and type or paste text as is (`g√©nero`).
- Use `\\` to break a line (or insert empty lines).
